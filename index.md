# Hi guys this is me

**this is my *first time* typing in Markdown so bear with me**

I remember my dad told me before going to college:
>Get a mac boy all real programmers love mac

and so I did. It took a while to get used to the operating system, but I definitely thought it was cool that I could run linux terminal commands like

```
ls
cd
top
touch
who
grep
```

and imagine that I am a real programmer. However, recently I've noticed a couple drawbacks: 

- screen breaks too easily _okthisispartiallymyfault_
- keyboard double types
- can't download and run games that well

I admit, I am not a huge gamer, or really picky about my screen (because I have an external monitor I can use), but the keyboard double typing really annoys me. That's why recently I also took the time and money to purchase an external keyboard from [target](https://www.target.com/p/logitech-wireless-combo-desktop/-/A-79778651#lnk=sametab).

So right now, my computer takes input via bluetooth, and displays to an external monitor. At this point I'm really just buying it for the OS and the controlling interface.

# Hobbies
Here is a list of things I do in my free time, not ranked in how often I do them or how much I enjoy them, but ranked from most mentally draining activities to least:

1. Reading
2. Playing music
3. Playing games
4. Excercising
5. Watching anime/youtube videos

It's interesting how if you reverse the list, you would get these activities ranked based on how often I do them. Except recently I have been trying to read more, because I noticed a gap between my read/write/speaking abilities compared to my peers.

Anyways, here's a humble hardworking guy
